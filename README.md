# Trend Following Analysis on EUR/USD

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for a trend-following analysis and backtesting project on the EUR/USD currency pair. Developed as part of a project at NYU, this notebook implements various trend-following strategies to analyze and predict the currency movements of the Euro against the US Dollar.

## Project Overview

The project aims to apply quantitative methods and financial theories to the forex market, specifically through trend-following strategies. By backtesting these strategies on historical EUR/USD data, we assess their potential profitability and viability.

## Repository Structure

- `EURUSD_TrendAnalysis_Backtest.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing all the code, visualizations, and analysis for the trend-following strategies.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have a Python environment capable of running Jupyter notebooks. Below are the steps to set up your environment and run the notebook.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yogyagit/NYU-Project-Trend-Following.git
``` 

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
```bash
cd NYU-Project-Trend-Following
```

3. Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook EURUSD_TrendAnalysis_Backtest.ipynb
```

### Usage
Once you have the notebook open, you can run the cells sequentially to see the analysis and results of the trend-following strategies on the EUR/USD currency pair.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. If you have suggestions to improve this analysis or additional strategies to test, please fork this repository and submit a pull request.
